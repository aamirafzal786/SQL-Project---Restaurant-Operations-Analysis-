The Assignment 📊 :

We’ve been asked to analyse the customer data to see which dishes are doing well and not doing well.



The Objectives 📊 :

1.Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what’s on the menu

2.Explore order_details table to get an idea of price range and date range.

3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.

Recommendations 📊 :

- What Cuisines do our top spenders usually like to order from?

Answer: The Highest Spent Orders tend to spend a lot on Italian food. We should keep these expensive Italian foods in our menu because people seem to be ordering them a lot ,especially our highest spend customers.
